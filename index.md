# Cool Code  
Amazing Inverse Square Root Algorithm from Quake III:  
```
float Q_rsqrt( float number )
{
    long i;
    float x2, y;
    const float threehalfs = 1.5F;

    x2 = number * 0.5F;
    y  = number;
    i  = * (long * ) &y;
    i  = 0x5f3759df - ( i >> 1 );
    y  = y * * (threehalfs - ( x2 * y * y ) );

    return y;
}
```
